			     IÉSEG belongs to the very closed club of French Grandes Écoles. Since 1997, it has been a member of the Conférence des Grandes Écoles (CGE), which currently includes 38 other management schools. In 2016, IÉSEG joined the very closed circle of schools (less than 1% worldwide) holding the "Triple Crown": EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA.The Financial Time ranks IÉSEG as the number one post-baccalaureate school in France and the 7th best French Master's in Management.
